Example document for an EdTech platform:

Project Name: EduVision — Online Coaching for Entrance Exams
Prepared for: Founders & Tech Team
Date: September 2025

----------------------------------------------------------
1. Overview

EduVision is an EdTech startup aimed at providing live interactive classes and recorded lectures for students preparing for national-level entrance exams. The platform will host thousands of students simultaneously, especially during peak admission months.

We aim to deliver seamless learning experiences through video streaming, AI-driven personalized course recommendations, and secure student data management.

Expected Scale:
  • Daily active users: ~50,000
  • Peak concurrency: ~3,000 users at the same time
  • Storage needs: ~20 TB (primarily lecture videos and transcripts)
  • Monthly infra budget: ~$8,000

----------------------------------------------------------
3. Non-Functional Requirements

• Performance: API response latency should remain under 150 ms for quizzes and interactions. Video startup latency should be <300 ms globally.
• Availability: 99.9% uptime, especially during live classes.
• Integration: Event-driven processing for handling lecture uploads, automatic transcript generation, and indexing.
• Messaging: Asynchronous communication required for scheduling tasks, notifications, and event pipelines.

----------------------------------------------------------
4. Data & AI Needs

• Lecture videos (~20 TB) stored with long-term archival of past years’ content.
• NLP pipeline required to process lecture transcripts and index them for search.
• Recommender system to suggest personalized content → requires medium-to-large AI model training on student behavior data.
• Training workloads are compute-intensive and will occasionally require GPU-based infrastructure.
